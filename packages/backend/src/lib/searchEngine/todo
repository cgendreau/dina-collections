* Move data interface to be separate thing
* clean up and commit

Next
* Move batch execute
* Create map lib in common
* Use map lib to map specimens in setup initial data


* use new map lib and data interface when mapping specimen
* Add possibilito to create custom index in memory for creating specimens
* Use same index with some kind of setting to build it to the dataInterface cache
* create new concept like sequalize that is in memory index. Might make sense to treat cache the same way
